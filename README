CadillacEdgeDeploy
==================

Is your deployed rails application frozen to a particular revision?  If so, when a new version of rails is released how easy is it for you to upgrade?

Are you living on the edge of rails?  If so, how do you move to a more recent revision when you notice an enhancement you want to take advantage of?

Switching to a different version of rails should be easy.  

Mike Clark described a number of ways to manage your rails versions in this blog post:

http://clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom/2007/01/18#ManagingVersionsWithCap

Mike wrote of a "Cadillac Approach" in referring to Rick Olson's code that makes managing rails versions quite cinchy. 

This plugin is basically a rip-off of that blog post and Rick's code.  

I refactored things a bit primarily because I needed the approach to work even if Rails wasn't installed on the server I was deploying to.  I've also changed it since to work with git rather than svn.



Example
=======

To use the plugin, create config/rails_revision.rb like this:

  RAILS_REVISION = '745359a49452da34978724144eaa318b8a363e08'

Lastly on your development environment run `rake cadillac_edge_deploy`, which will create $HOME/rails/rev_745359a49452da34978724144eaa318b8a363e08.
That's it. When deploying with capistrano cadillac_edge_deploy will be run automatically for you on the target machine.

When you'd like the server to start using a different revision of rails, just adjust the RAILS_REVISION variable in your rails_revision.rb and deploy again.
